[b]=== Journey Mode Only! ===[/b]

This mod adds a single item called 'Tome of Research Sharing', allowing you to store your current Journey Mode 'researched items' to be able to share it with other players.

Notes:
* Partial research progress is only stored for modded items (because it's not set in stone, as mod developers may change the limits in their mods)
* Using the tome to gain research for modded items also works if no other mods are loaded
* Can be used in singleplayer aswell by storing the tome in a chest

Recipe: 1 Book at any Bookcase.
